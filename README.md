# SOS-Game
SOS Game for two players

Game Rules:
The game of SOS, is played between two players.
The game begins play on an empty square grid of at least n×n squares. For this app, play is on a 5×5 board.
Each player takes a turn. On a player’s turn, they choose to place an “S” or an “O” symbol, and place this symbol in an empty cell3.
If the newly placed letter completes an “SOS” sequence vertically, diagonally or horizontally, that player scores one point and gets another turn4 (until placing a symbol does not complete a sequence, in which case it becomes the other player’s turn).
Play continues until there are no empty cells left, the winner is the player with the highest score. If the scores are the same, then the game is a draw.
